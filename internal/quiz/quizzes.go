					2: "Time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU)",
					3: "Pointer dereference",
				},
				Correct:     []int{2},
				Explanation: "A time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) vulnerability is a type of race condition where a program checks the state of a resource (like a file's permissions) but then performs an action on that resource assuming the state hasn't changed. An attacker can race to change the resource between the check and the use, leading to a security bypass.",

					3: "There is no functional difference; the terms are interchangeable.",
				},
				Correct:     []int{1},
				Explanation: "A SIEM is primarily a detection and analysis tool. It aggregates logs, correlates events, and creates alerts. A SOAR platform takes the output from the SIEM (and other tools) and uses 'playbooks' to automate and orchestrate the incident response workflow, such as quarantining a host or disabling a user account.",

				Question: "Which of the following describes the security benefits of using immutable infrastructure? (Select TWO)",
				Answers: map[int]string{
					0: "Servers can be patched and reconfigured in place without any downtime.",

					4: "It simplifies user account management.",
					5: "It automatically encrypts all data at rest.",
				},
				Correct:     []int{2, 3},
				Explanation: "In an immutable infrastructure model, servers are never modified after they are deployed. If a change is needed (like a patch), new servers are built from a golden image and deployed, and the old ones are terminated. This prevents unauthorized changes (configuration drift) and makes it trivial to roll back by simply deploying the previous version of the image.",

				},
				Correct:     []int{2},
				Explanation: "This policy, known as mandatory vacation, is an administrative control designed to detect fraud. If an employee is engaged in fraudulent activity, it often requires their constant presence to manipulate records or cover their tracks. Forcing them to be away makes it more likely that irregularities will be discovered.",
